This is the matlab code that has been used to create the results as mentioned in the manuscript. Unfortunately, over several iterations, the code has grown somewhat opaque and less neat. Apologies for this.

The code is dependent on ‘The Decoding Toolbox’, which can be downloaded here: https://sites.google.com/site/tdtdecodingtoolbox/

The main analysis can be found in analysis4.m. The other functions are called upon in this script. The behavioural decoding analysis is independent from this.
